# ðŸ“¡ Super-Heterodyne Receiver Simulation in MATLAB

This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of a **Super-Heterodyne Receiver** simulation for multiple AM-SC (Amplitude Modulation â€“ Suppressed Carrier) audio signals.  
It demonstrates the complete RF signal processing chain â€” from baseband audio to RF transmission, intermediate frequency (IF) conversion, and final demodulation back to baseband.

## âœ¨ Features
- ðŸŽµ Reads and processes multiple `.wav` audio signals.
- ðŸŽš Converts stereo audio to mono for signal processing.
- ðŸ“¶ Implements **AM-SC modulation** for each signal with configurable carrier frequencies.
- ðŸ“¡ Combines multiple modulated signals into a single RF channel.
- ðŸŽ¯ Band-pass filtering for channel selection at **RF** and **IF** stages.
- ðŸ”„ Down-conversion to IF and then to baseband.
- ðŸ“Š Visualization of:
  - Time-domain signals
  - Frequency spectra
  - Intermediate stages
- ðŸ”Š Plays the recovered audio of the selected channel after demodulation.

## ðŸ›  Stages Implemented
1. **Baseband Audio Processing** â€“ Read audio, mono conversion, and zero-padding.
2. **AM-SC Modulation** â€“ Carrier generation and signal modulation.
3. **RF Stage** â€“ Combine signals and visualize spectrum.
4. **Bandpass Filtering** â€“ Select one channel from the combined RF.
5. **IF Stage** â€“ Down-convert to Intermediate Frequency.
6. **Baseband Stage** â€“ Final down-conversion and low-pass filtering.
7. **Audio Output** â€“ Resample and playback recovered audio.
